## HK 513 (Fall 2024)
Repository to demonstrate the final reproducibility deliverable for HK 513 (Fall 24).

### Study Goals
The goal of this project is to assess changes in the level of confidence 
students enrolled in HK 513 (Fall '24) feel about their ability to conduct 
specific data management tasks using R. The analysis compared the self-reported 
confidence felt by students at the start of the semester (Week 1) and the end of
the semester (Week 14) to see if there was a change in confidence as a result
of engaging in the course.
